## Developer

I'm a ruby developer and it is my first experience with [React JS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and with firebase database.
Firebase is a very nice library and an easy to use infrastructure. Google provide all you need for local testing.
I learnt the lifecycle of React component and how to build SPA.

### Available Scripts

```
npm run build
npm run start # to execute firebase start
npm run deploy # to execute firebase deploy
```
